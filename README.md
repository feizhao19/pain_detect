# Pain Detection

## Description
Pain Detection is a deep learning-based project aimed at predicting the pain severity level using facial information from images. Leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, this project analyzes facial expressions to assess pain states, offering a non-invasive method to evaluate pain state. 


## Technologies Used
- Deep Learning
- Python
- Conda for environment management


## Installation Instructions
To set up the Pain Detection project locally, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
4. Create a Conda environment using the `env.yml` file located in the `env` folder:
   ```bash
   conda env create -f env/env.yml

## Features
- Utilizes state-of-the-art face detection models to accurately extract facial information from images.
- Predicts pain state based on facial expressions, aiding in medical assessments and research.
